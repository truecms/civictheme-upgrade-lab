# CivicTheme customisation register (template)

This file illustrates the canonical path and structure for the CivicTheme
customisation register:

- `docs/civic-theme-upgrades/customisations.md`

Destination Drupal projects that adopt this framework MUST maintain their
own version of this file, capturing project-specific CivicTheme
sub-themes and customisations.

Use this template as a starting point and replace the sample entry with
real customisations in each destination project.

- [ ] C001 Example sub-theme overrides (Twig, SCSS, JS) – replace with
      real items in destination projects.
