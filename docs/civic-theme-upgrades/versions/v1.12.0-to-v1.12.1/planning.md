# Planning notes: CivicTheme v1.12.0 → v1.12.1

This scratchpad exists for quick notes while running the upgrade in this
directory. The authoritative instructions remain in `spec.md`, `tasks.md`, and
`playbook.md`.

## Pre-upgrade capture: custom library attachments (T304)

Use this table to record custom sub-theme libraries and where they are
attached before making changes. It supports T304 and later restoration in
T313.

| Library | Files referenced | Where attached (Twig/preprocess) | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-----------------------------------|-------|
|         |                  |                                   |       |
